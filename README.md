## Hello, I'm Kadir Acaroglu!

I'm a computer science student passionate about cybersecurity, game development, and web development. I pursue various projects driven by my academic curriculum and my personal curiosity.

### Languages & Skills:
  - **Proficient:** C#, Java
  - **Comfortable:** Python, JavaScript
  - **Learning:** C, Dart + Flutter
  - **Other Skills:** HTML/CSS, Docker, MySQL, Postman, Blender scripting, cybersecurity/network concepts with Python implementations

### I'm currently working on:
  - Learning Dart and Flutter to build mobile applications
  - Exploring Node.js and React.js to expand my back-end development knowledge
  - Writing Python for Blender add-ons and functional everyday tools

### About me:
  - Documentation, YouTube and websites like StackOverflow are my go-tos. AI is only there for me to scream at when I'm frustrated, when I'm reading someone else's code or when I'm **utterly** clueless, which doesn't happen *too* often.
  - I create 3D characters and animations using Blender as a hobby and plan to integrate Python into this process.
  - I should probably drink less coffee and/or energy drinks. :)
